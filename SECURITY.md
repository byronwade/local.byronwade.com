## 🚨 Incident Response Plan

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Critical** | System compromise, data breach, or service unavailable | 15 minutes | Immediate C-level notification |
| **High** | Security control failure, significant vulnerability | 1 hour | Security team + engineering leads |
| **Medium** | Potential security issue, service degradation | 4 hours | Security team + product owner |
| **Low** | Minor security concern, informational | 24 hours | Security team review |

### Response Procedures

#### 1. Detection & Analysis (0-30 minutes)
- **Automated Detection**: SIEM alerts and monitoring systems
- **Manual Detection**: User reports or security team discovery
- **Initial Triage**: Classify severity and impact assessment
- **Team Notification**: Alert appropriate response team members

#### 2. Containment (30 minutes - 2 hours)
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate affected systems
- **Evidence Preservation**: Secure logs and forensic data
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders based on severity
- **Temporary Measures**: Implement workarounds if needed

#### 3. Eradication & Recovery (2-24 hours)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify and eliminate the threat
- **System Restoration**: Restore services from clean backups
- **Security Improvements**: Implement additional controls
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during recovery

#### 4. Post-Incident (24-72 hours)
- **Lessons Learned**: Document findings and improvements
- **Process Updates**: Update security procedures
- **Training**: Conduct additional security training if needed
- **Communication**: Final notification to stakeholders
