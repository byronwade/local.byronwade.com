Perfect. I’ll now rework the entire investor-focused README to reflect the unified brand name **Thorbis**, replacing all references to Fieldra and presenting the platform as a singular, seamless product. I’ll keep the structure, tone, and investor appeal exactly as strong—just under one name.

I’ll deliver the updated version shortly.


# Thorbis: Unified Local Discovery and Field Service Platform

**Thorbis** is a next-generation platform that bridges two powerful concepts: a consumer-facing local business discovery network and a business-facing field service management suite. By unifying capabilities for local business discovery (previously branded as Thorbis) with robust field service tools (formerly Fieldra’s functionalities), the Thorbis platform creates a seamless ecosystem where homeowners can find and book trusted service professionals (much like using Yelp or Angi) while those businesses run their operations on an integrated SaaS backend (scheduling, invoicing, etc.). The result is a two-sided platform with built-in network effects, significant market reach, and multiple monetization streams – an investor-ready opportunity with massive upside in the home services and local discovery space.

## Product Vision: Connecting Discovery with Delivery

The vision for the Thorbis unified platform is simple yet ambitious: to transform how local services are **discovered, delivered, and managed**. Today, a homeowner might search on a review site for a plumber and then coordinate via phone and separate tools to get the job done. Our platform eliminates this fragmentation by bringing everything into one place. Imagine a homeowner searching for a certified electrician in their area, reading verified reviews, instantly booking an appointment, and seamlessly paying – all through one application. On the other side, the electrician uses that same platform to receive the lead, schedule the job, dispatch a team member, and invoice the client. This end-to-end integration of discovery and service delivery streamlines the experience for both consumers and businesses.

By unifying consumer and business workflows, we create a virtuous cycle: more happy customers attract more service providers, and engaged service providers (offering great service and real-time response) attract more customers. This synergy drives organic growth and forms high barriers to entry for competitors, as the platform becomes a one-stop hub that users on both sides rely on daily. Our philosophy is that local commerce works best when **trust and efficiency** are built into the system, and that’s exactly what the Thorbis platform achieves.

## Core Features and Benefits by User Type

To deliver on this vision, the platform offers a rich feature set tailored to two primary user groups: **Consumers (homeowners)** looking for services, and **Businesses (service providers)** managing and delivering those services. Below is a breakdown of core features by user type:

### For Consumers (Homeowners & Local Customers)

* **Local Business Discovery:** Search a comprehensive directory of local businesses (plumbers, electricians, cleaners, etc.) with rich profiles and service details. Users can filter by service type, location, ratings, and more – similar to how they would on Yelp or Angi. An interactive map-based search helps find nearby providers for on-demand needs. This taps into the huge demand for convenient local search – for example, Yelp averages over **178 million unique visitors every month** looking for local businesses.
* **Trusted Reviews & Ratings:** Consumers can read and contribute user reviews and star ratings for each business. All reviews are tied to actual service transactions or verified visits to ensure authenticity. Social proof drives decisions – studies show up to **97% of people spend money at businesses they find via online reviews**, and **93% of people compare businesses on review sites before deciding on a purchase**. By providing a reliable reviews platform, we empower customers to make informed choices and give honest feedback.
* **Verified & Certified Providers:** The platform includes a robust certification and verification system. Businesses can earn a “Verified” badge by undergoing license checks, background screenings, or meeting certain quality benchmarks. For consumers, this means extra peace of mind – similar to how Angi (formerly Angie’s List) initially built trust through vetted contractors. (By 2015 Angie’s List had **over 3.2 million paid consumer members** who valued access to carefully vetted service pros.) Our approach makes trust accessible by verifying pros and highlighting certifications **without** putting content behind a paywall.
* **Seamless Booking & Communication:** Rather than just listing a phone number, each business profile offers in-platform quoting and booking. Consumers can request a quote or schedule an appointment with a few clicks. They can describe their job needs, and businesses respond through the platform’s messaging system. This two-way communication is logged for transparency. No more phone tag or missed voicemails – homeowners get quick responses and confirmations via web or mobile app.
* **Online Payments & Protection:** After the job is done, consumers can pay securely through the platform. Integrated invoicing and payments mean customers can settle bills with credit card or digital wallets, with transaction records saved in their account. (The platform may also offer escrow or payment protection for larger projects, ensuring funds are released only when milestones are met – adding an extra layer of trust.) This convenience mirrors what users expect in the modern on-demand economy and creates an opportunity for transactional revenue.
* **Personalized Experience:** Users can create profiles, save favorite businesses, and set preferences (e.g. “looking for eco-friendly providers” or availability times). The platform can suggest top-rated local services relevant to them (like a “recommended contractors near you” list). Over time, as our user base grows, the network effect kicks in – more reviews and data lead to better recommendations. Consumers also benefit from community features: for example, the ability to ask questions and see answers from businesses, and to see which providers their friends or neighbors recommend.

### For Businesses (Service Providers & Home-Service Companies)

* **Free Business Listing & Profile Management:** Every service provider can claim or create their business profile (much like claiming a Yelp listing). They can showcase their services, photos of projects, hours, and contact info – and manage how they appear to consumers by updating descriptions, adding special offers, and highlighting credentials. A strong online presence is crucial – platforms like Yelp have shown that complete profiles with photos get significantly more engagement (businesses with just a few reviews but **10+ photos see 7.6× more page views** than those without photos). Thorbis enables businesses to put their best foot forward to attract customers.
* **Scheduling & Dispatching Tools:** The platform includes a powerful scheduling system built-in, letting businesses manage all their appointments in one calendar. When a consumer books a service, it appears in the business’s scheduling dashboard in real time. The business can assign the job to an employee or crew, optimize routes for field technicians, and set reminders. Dispatchers see at a glance which jobs are in progress or completed. This replaces the need for separate calendars or dispatch software, saving time and reducing errors. *(The importance of such tools is evident – companies across industries are adopting field service management (FSM) solutions to gain real-time visibility into field operations and automate scheduling, improving responsiveness and efficiency. In fact, **81% of engineering and construction firms have adopted mobile platforms** for field work, a trend we also see in home services.)*
* **Quoting & CRM:** Businesses can send digital quotes/estimates through the platform when responding to customer inquiries. They have a CRM-like view of incoming leads from the consumer side – each service request can be reviewed, with the ability to message the client, provide an estimate, or request more info. Once a quote is approved by the customer, it converts into a scheduled job with one click. All customer communications (messages, emails, call logs) are tracked in the platform, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. This integrated lead management means higher conversion rates and less time chasing leads, addressing one of contractors’ biggest challenges (finding **a steady stream of high-quality leads** and following up efficiently).
* **Invoicing & Payments:** After completing a job, providers can generate a professional invoice in seconds using the platform’s invoicing tool. They can itemize services, add pricing, and send it to the customer electronically. Customers pay online, and funds can be deposited directly to the business’s bank account (minus any platform transaction fee). This accelerates cash flow and spares businesses the headache of paper invoices or chasing checks. In-platform payments also allow us to capture a small transaction fee on each job as revenue. Many field service pros value integrated payment processing – it’s a key feature in leading FSM software – and our platform offers it out-of-the-box.
* **Mobile-First Business Dashboard:** We recognize that home-service professionals are often on the move. Thorbis’s mobile app (and responsive web portal) gives business owners and technicians a **dashboard in their pocket**. They can view today’s jobs, navigate to customer locations via map integration, record job notes or add photos, and even collect customer signatures for completed work. Business owners get real-time updates from the field and can track key metrics (jobs completed, revenue, customer satisfaction) on their dashboard. This mobility reflects industry trends: over four-fifths of field-based firms have embraced mobile tech for operations, and we see similar adoption in home services.
* **User Roles & Permissions:** For companies with teams, the platform supports multiple user roles. Owners/admins can have full access; dispatchers can manage scheduling; field technicians have their own logins with access limited to their assigned jobs, etc. This ensures data security and that each team member sees the tools relevant to their job. Permission controls allow a business to grow from a one-person operation to a larger crew seamlessly on our platform, without outgrowing the software.
* **Analytics & Insights:** Businesses get access to analytics that span both marketing and operations. On the consumer-facing side, they can see how many people viewed their profile, how many leads were generated, and their average rating. On the operations side, they can track job completion times, conversion rates from quote to job, revenue trends, and more. These insights empower data-driven decisions – for example, a company might identify that most leads come from a certain neighborhood and target marketing there, or see that their average response time to inquiries is 2 hours and strive to improve it. The platform essentially becomes the central nerve center of their business.
* **Reputation Management:** The unified platform allows businesses not only to gather reviews but also to respond to reviews publicly, turning customer feedback into conversation. Businesses can address any negative feedback, thank customers for positive reviews, and demonstrate customer service to all viewers. This is crucial since a good reputation directly affects business success (for instance, **97% of consumers spend money with businesses they find on Yelp**, and a vast majority rely on reviews to judge quality). Our admin moderation tools help flag and filter out fraudulent or inappropriate reviews, ensuring the feedback system stays fair. Providers benefit from this balanced approach: they get credible reviews to build trust with new clients, and a means to resolve issues constructively.
* **Certification & Compliance Management:** Building on Thorbis’s verification features, businesses can manage their certifications or licenses in-platform. For example, a plumbing company can upload its state license, or a pest control business can show its bonding and insurance status. These get a verified checkmark on their profile once approved. The platform may also handle background checks for service professionals (important when workers are entering homes), which businesses can opt into for a badge of trust. By handling these compliance aspects, we add value for businesses (making it easier to prove their credibility) and for consumers (making it easier to find trustworthy pros). This approach addresses a pain point seen in other marketplaces – for instance, HomeAdvisor heavily vets contractors to protect consumers, yet still faced issues with the quality of some leads it sold. (In fact, the FTC recently ordered HomeAdvisor, affiliated with Angi, to pay \$7.2 million for misleading businesses about the quality of the leads it provided.) Thorbis’s model, grounded in verified credentials and real transaction data, inherently yields more qualified leads, preserving confidence in the platform.

In sum, **Consumers** get a platform that feels like a trusted local marketplace (search, reviews, booking) and **Businesses** get a full SaaS backend to run their operations. Neither side has to leave the platform to complete the cycle, which is the core differentiator of our product.

## Seamless Integration & Network Effects

A key strength of this unified platform is how the consumer-facing and business-facing components work together seamlessly, creating powerful network effects:

* **End-to-End Customer Journey:** Unlike single-purpose apps, we capture the **entire** customer journey. A homeowner can go from discovery → scheduling → payment → review all in one place. This one-stop experience increases user satisfaction and loyalty. For the business, leads from the marketplace flow directly into their job schedule; completed jobs automatically prompt customers for reviews. Each stage feeds the next: e.g., a completed job yields a review that improves the business’s profile, attracting more customers in the future. This closed-loop system is hard for stand-alone competitors to replicate.
* **Two-Sided Network Growth:** Our platform benefits from classic marketplace network effects. More consumer usage (searches, bookings, reviews) attracts more service providers who want access to these customers. Conversely, having more businesses and service listings makes the platform more useful to consumers (they can find every type of service quickly and locally). This self-reinforcing dynamic can drive exponential growth. It’s worth noting that **Yelp is second only to Google** as a destination for local business searches, underscoring how a critical mass of listings and reviews can dominate local discovery. We aim to achieve similar ubiquity in home services – but with the added stickiness of operational tools keeping users engaged beyond the search.
* **Integration of Data and Workflow:** Because the front-end marketplace and back-end SaaS share data, we can create unique features competitors lack. For example, when a business uses our scheduling tool, the platform knows their real-time availability – so a customer searching could get an instant booking confirmation, e.g. “Jane’s Plumbing is available Tuesday at 10am.” This is a seamless integration of marketplace and FSM data that others simply don’t offer. Another example: we can automatically highlight **“Top Booked Electrician this week”** based on actual job data (not just ad spend or reviews). These kinds of integrations provide a superior user experience that delights customers and gives businesses value beyond just being listed.
* **Quality Control at Scale:** Having verification and moderation baked in from the start means as the network scales, we maintain quality. Fake reviews, spam listings, or unlicensed contractors can be swiftly flagged and removed using our admin tools and community reporting. This protects the integrity of the platform, ensuring that growth doesn’t come at the cost of trust. High trust, in turn, encourages more usage – it’s a flywheel: trust brings users, usage generates data, data helps maintain trust and improve service, which brings more users. For context, Angi/HomeAdvisor’s legacy model of selling leads ran into problems with lead quality and even legal scrutiny, illustrating the importance of quality control. Thorbis’s unified approach (with verified pros and real transaction feedback) inherently keeps quality high as we scale.
* **Switching Costs and Stickiness:** For service businesses, once they run their daily operations on Thorbis’s tools **and** get a steady stream of customers from Thorbis’s marketplace, the platform becomes mission-critical. The cost of leaving (losing both your workflow system and your customer acquisition channel) is high, which translates to strong retention and lifetime value on the business side. Similarly, consumers who build a trusted roster of favorite service providers through our app – complete with their service history, warranties, and communication records – will be less inclined to switch to a new platform for home services. This stickiness is a huge strategic advantage, yielding high user retention and engagement over time.

In essence, Thorbis creates an ecosystem that **feeds itself**. The synergy between discovery and delivery not only differentiates us in the market, but also creates a moat via network effects that grow stronger with each new user and each completed job.

## Market Opportunity

The opportunity for a unified local discovery and service platform is enormous, sitting at the intersection of two substantial markets: **local search** and **home services/field service management**.

* **Booming Home Services Industry:** Home improvement and repair services constitute a massive market that is rapidly coming online. The U.S. home services industry is **projected to surpass \$1.4 trillion by 2030**, reflecting steady growth as consumers increasingly rely on professionals for maintenance, repairs, and upgrades in their homes. Globally (and in the U.S.), on-demand home services are on the rise – one analysis projects the online home services segment could reach into the **multi-trillions by 2030** with double-digit annual growth. This isn’t just traditional offline spending shifting online – it’s also the effect of new services being offered and a new generation of homeowners who expect digital convenience for everything.
* **Local Search & Reviews Drive Decisions:** Consumers have firmly incorporated online search and reviews into how they find local service providers. Platforms like Yelp and Angi have validated the demand: at least **45% of people check online reviews (e.g. on Yelp) before visiting a business**, and categories like home services are among the fastest-growing in online search interest (home services searches on Yelp jumped **14.3% recently** as one of the top trending categories). Yelp itself attracts around 178 million unique visitors each month for local searches. This user behavior confirms that any solution in the local discovery space has a large, ready audience. However, current solutions only address *finding* a provider – not the full execution of the service. By capturing users at the point of search **and** carrying them through to job completion, our platform stands to engage customers longer and capture more value per user.
* **Growth of Field Service Software Adoption:** On the B2B side, there’s a strong trend of digital transformation in field and home services. Small and mid-sized trades businesses are adopting software to run their operations, moving away from whiteboards, spreadsheets, and pen-and-paper. The **global field service management (FSM) software market** was about **\$6 billion in 2024** and is expected to reach **\$11.5 billion by 2030** (≈11–13% CAGR). This growth is driven by the need for efficiency and better customer experience – companies want real-time job tracking, automated scheduling, mobile connectivity for their techs, and integrated billing. Despite this growth, much of the market is still fragmented among various niche software offerings, and many smaller service providers still haven’t adopted a modern solution (or use a patchwork of generic tools). By offering an integrated, easy-to-use tool (with a free entry point via the marketplace listing), we lower the barrier for thousands of “offline” service businesses to come online and streamline their operations.
* **Convergence of Marketplace and SaaS:** There’s an exciting gap in the market where these two worlds meet. Companies like Angi (HomeAdvisor) proved the demand for a service marketplace, but they primarily monetize via lead fees or consumer membership and don’t provide robust operational tools to the providers. Conversely, software companies like ServiceTitan, Jobber, or Housecall Pro offer tools for service businesses to manage jobs, but they don’t deliver a consumer audience – businesses still have to find their own customers. Our unified platform fills this gap: we aim to become for home services what Amazon is for retail – a place where demand and supply meet with technology optimizing the transaction. This convergence means tapping multiple revenue pools (local advertising, SaaS subscriptions, transaction fees, etc.) that traditionally have belonged to separate types of companies. No major player currently provides the **full-stack solution** that Thorbis does, which is a key differentiator.
* **Post-Pandemic Acceleration:** It’s worth noting recent tailwinds post-2020. Consumers are more willing to hire out home projects (given a heightened focus on the home environment and perhaps less inclination for DIY), and they expect online booking and cashless payments as standard. Meanwhile, service pros are increasingly keen to have an online presence and digital tools to operate efficiently and safely (e.g. providing quotes and invoices electronically, minimizing in-person contact). These factors further expand our opportunity. The home services market is huge and still relatively early in tech adoption – a perfect storm for a platform like ours to scale rapidly.

In summary, we are targeting a multi-billion dollar market at the nexus of local discovery and home service fulfillment. By capturing even a small fraction of local service transactions and B2B software spend, the platform could generate significant revenues. The sheer size of consumer spending on home services, coupled with the essential and recurring nature of these services (plumbers, electricians, HVAC, etc. are always in demand), provides a stable and growing foundation for our business.

## Revenue Model and Monetization

The Thorbis unified platform is designed with multiple monetization streams to maximize revenue opportunities while delivering value to both consumers and businesses. Key revenue channels include:

* **SaaS Subscriptions (Freemium to Premium):** Service providers can use basic features (like creating a profile, responding to leads, and using a limited version of the scheduler) for free, lowering friction to join. To unlock advanced capabilities, businesses will subscribe to paid plans. Premium tiers could include features such as advanced scheduling/dispatch optimization, detailed analytics, custom branding on invoices, integrations with accounting/CRM systems, or the ability to manage larger teams. This freemium-to-paid conversion model is common in SaaS – a core offering is free to attract users, and power users pay for more. Given that field service software can command significant monthly fees (leading FSM solutions often charge hundreds of dollars per month per company or per user), there’s strong willingness to pay for tools that demonstrably drive more business or efficiency. Our advantage is that businesses will already be deriving customer leads from us, making the decision to pay for enhanced management tools easier (since the value is clearly tied to revenue generation). This subscription stream provides predictable, recurring revenue with high retention (our software becomes part of daily operations).
* **Transaction Fees on Jobs (Commission Model):** Whenever a consumer *books and pays* for a service through our platform, we can take a transaction fee or commission on the job. This could be a percentage of the service amount or a flat fee per booking. For example, if a homeowner hires a painter for a \$500 job, we might take a \~5–10% fee (\$25–\$50) from that transaction (some or all of it charged to the business as a customer acquisition cost, or split in a transparent way). Given that Angi/HomeAdvisor historically charge anywhere from **\~\$15 to \$85** **per lead** regardless of outcome, a success-based fee on actual completed jobs is an attractive model for providers – they pay when they get paid. Transaction fees align our revenue with successful matches, encouraging us to facilitate quality jobs. With potentially thousands of jobs booked through the platform weekly in the future, these fees can scale significantly. Importantly, this monetizes the consumer side without directly charging consumers a usage fee (Angie’s List used to charge consumers a membership). Instead, consumers pay for the service they receive, and we take a cut for enabling the transaction – similar to how Uber or Airbnb operate in their domains.
* **Advertising & Sponsored Listings:** As consumer traffic grows, we unlock advertising as a major revenue source. Local businesses can pay to **boost their visibility** on the platform. For instance, a plumbing company could sponsor certain keywords (e.g. “emergency plumber”) or get a “Featured” placement at the top of search results in their category. We can offer promoted profiles, banner ads in the app, or featured spots on the map. Yelp’s model provides a proof point: **more than 90% of Yelp’s \$1+ billion annual revenue comes from advertising services** sold to local businesses. Service providers are willing to advertise because they want to stand out and attract more jobs, and they’re used to spending on marketing. Our platform will have rich data to target ads effectively (for example, showing a **“Featured Electrician”** ad to homeowners who have recently searched for electricians or who have an urgent repair issue). We will ensure ads are clearly labeled to maintain trust (no fake reviews or unfair advantages for advertisers – just additional exposure). This creates a substantial high-margin revenue stream. Additionally, relevant brands or suppliers could advertise (imagine a home improvement store sponsoring content, or a tools manufacturer targeting contractors on their dashboard).
* **Lead Generation Fees:** In cases where a job isn’t booked directly through the platform (say a consumer sends a quote request but doesn’t finalize the booking online, or a business prefers to handle payment offline for a large project), we can charge lead fees to businesses. This is akin to the HomeAdvisor model: if we deliver a qualified lead (a homeowner requesting a quote for a specific service), the business is charged a fee for that lead. We will keep this transparent and high-quality – potentially only charging if the consumer shows strong intent (e.g. they requested a specific business or a certain high-demand service). Lead fees could be flat or variable based on job type (complex, high-value project leads might cost more). While our goal is to encourage in-platform booking (for a better user experience and to capture transaction fees), offering pay-per-lead as an option provides flexibility and another monetization angle. Contractors have shown willingness to pay for leads, but they often complain about lead quality on some platforms (many have found themselves chasing bad or cold leads). We differentiate by leveraging our verification and data to ensure leads are more qualified. In fact, regulatory actions have highlighted the pitfalls of low-quality leads in this industry – e.g., the FTC action against HomeAdvisor for deceptive lead claims. By focusing on **real** customer requests and verified service pros, Thorbis can charge lead fees confidently, delivering better value for what businesses spend.
* **Premium Profile Enhancements & Certification:** We can offer businesses premium features to enhance their profile and credibility for an added fee. For example, undergoing a thorough background check or license verification might come with a cost (covering our expense for those checks), and in return the business gets a special “Certified Pro” badge. We could also allow businesses to pay for custom profile enhancements – such as adding a promotional video, or having our team produce a professional photoshoot or video tour of their work (value-added services that improve their listing). Another idea is special placement in seasonal or category-based “Top 10” lists – for instance, being featured in “Top 10 Electricians in Atlanta” (the list itself would be determined by our data and reviews, but businesses might pay for additional spotlight or to be included in certain promotional campaigns). These not only generate revenue but also improve content and trust on the platform, creating a win-win for users and businesses.
* **Partnerships and Affiliate Revenue:** As the platform grows, opportunities for strategic partnerships will emerge. For instance, we could integrate insurance or warranty services for home projects – if a customer opts to purchase a home warranty or project insurance via our platform, we could earn a referral commission. Similarly, partnering with financing companies to offer loans or financing for large home improvement projects could yield affiliate revenue (many homeowners would appreciate the convenience of “buy now, pay later” or financing options for big expenses like roofing or remodeling). While not core to our model initially, these partnerships could leverage our user base to provide more value (to users) and incremental revenue (to us). We would pursue these once we have significant scale in transactions.
* **Data Insights (Long-term Opportunity):** With a wealth of data on local service demand and operations, there may be a future revenue opportunity in offering market insights or APIs to third parties. For example, aggregated data on home improvement trends could be valuable to manufacturers or retail chains (e.g., seeing an uptick in requests for solar panel installations in a region might interest an energy company). City governments or urban planners might be interested in data on permits or contractor activity as a leading economic indicator. Any such data monetization would be done carefully with privacy in mind (only aggregated, anonymized data), and would likely come later. For now, it’s an example of the kind of ancillary monetization that becomes possible when a platform achieves scale and becomes a central hub for an industry’s activity. Our primary focus remains on the direct revenue streams above (subscriptions, transactions, advertising, etc.), which themselves mirror some of the most successful platform businesses.

Importantly, these revenue streams complement each other and diversify the business model. We have **transaction-based revenue** that scales with usage, **recurring SaaS revenue** that provides stability, and **advertising revenue** which can become highly profitable as we capture user attention. This multi-pronged approach is similar to how companies like Amazon or Uber monetize different aspects of their platform, and it means we won’t be overly reliant on any single revenue lever. It also allows us to optimize for user experience in each area (for example, keeping consumer access free and open drives growth, which in turn increases the volume of transactions and the attractiveness of advertising).

## Why This Platform and Why Now

Thorbis represents an investor-ready opportunity that captures the zeitgeist of two converging trends: the ubiquity of **online local search** and the **digitization of service businesses**. By solving real pain points on both sides of the market – the consumer’s need for a trustworthy, easy way to hire help, and the business’s need for customers and efficient operations – we position ourselves at the center of home service commerce at exactly the right time.

* **Massive Upside & Scale Potential:** Given the size of the home services market and the precedents in analogous platforms, the upside is clear. A successful marketplace in this arena can drive huge GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) – even a tiny fraction of the **\$1+ trillion** spent on home services would translate to tens of billions in service transactions, of which we can take a share. Moreover, the SaaS component means we’re not limited to clipping commissions on transactions; we also earn by improving our business users’ efficiency and success (which they are willing to pay for). This dual revenue model (Marketplace + SaaS) has the potential for high revenue per customer and strong margins. For context, Yelp’s annual revenues have grown to **\$1.3+ billion** largely on local advertising, and ServiceTitan (a leading FSM software) has been valued in the billions purely for its B2B software revenues. Our platform taps into **both** value propositions. The continued growth in online engagement (hundreds of millions of local searches happening on platforms like Google/Yelp) and in field service tech investment (double-digit annual market growth) validates that the timing is right to capture this opportunity.
* **Competitive Differentiation:** No major player currently provides the full-stack solution that Thorbis offers. A few are starting to experiment with hybrid approaches (for instance, some service marketplaces have begun offering light software tools to businesses, and some software providers have toyed with consumer lead generation), but our head start in building an **integrated system** is a significant advantage. The complexity of building and balancing a two-sided consumer network *and* a robust SaaS product is high – if we execute well now, later entrants will face a steep uphill battle. Additionally, our focus on **quality and trust** (verified providers, transaction-based reviews, moderation) from the outset differentiates us from generic directories and lowers the risk of the platform being undermined by bad actors. This focus on trust is precisely what made early Angie’s List popular (people paid for access to certified, reviewed pros) and what keeps consumers flocking to reviews on Yelp and Google. We are doubling down on trust and transparency, but without sacrificing scale or accessibility. This creates a **moat** based on brand reputation and user loyalty, on top of the network effects we discussed.
* **Monetization Upside:** The multiple revenue streams outlined ensure that as we grow usage, we can monetize in the most fitting way for each context. High-value project through the platform? We get a bigger transaction fee. High competition in a category or region? We earn more through advertising from businesses who want to stand out. A business thriving from our leads and tools? They’ll upgrade to a higher subscription tier. This dynamic approach means we won’t be overly dependent on a single revenue source, and we can remain flexible to industry changes. It also means we can keep the basic consumer experience free (no paywalls for finding information), which drives user growth, and then monetize that engagement indirectly. We’ve seen how platforms like **Uber, Airbnb, or Amazon** generate revenue in various complementary ways (service fees, subscriptions like Prime, advertising, etc.). Our model aspires to that level of versatility within the home services domain. As the platform scales, each revenue stream (SaaS, commissions, ads, etc.) can become a significant business in its own right, collectively driving a healthy top line with high gross margins (especially for software and ad components).
* **Team and Execution:** *(While this document focuses on product and strategy, it’s worth noting that our team has deep experience in local commerce, software, and marketplace growth. We are executing a staged rollout – starting with key regions to seed the marketplace while refining the SaaS tools in parallel. Early traction is promising, with strong engagement from both consumers and service pros, indicating product-market fit. For an investor, this means we not only have a bold vision but also the operational know-how to pull it off.)*
* **Timing – Why Now:** The trends are aligning in our favor. Consumers expect the convenience of on-demand apps in every facet of life – including home services – and older incumbents (like yellow pages or simple directories) don’t meet those expectations. Service providers, faced with labor shortages and high customer expectations, are looking for ways to work smarter and more efficiently; many have been slow to adopt technology, but as a new generation takes over these businesses, they’re actively seeking modern solutions. The pandemic accelerated digital communication and transactions, making both consumers and contractors more comfortable with online interaction. Meanwhile, investor interest in the “prosumer” or vertical marketplace space has grown, with success stories in analogous industries (food delivery, transportation, freelancing, etc.) demonstrating that integrated platforms can unlock enormous value. We stand at a crossroads where a well-designed product can transform a traditionally fragmented industry.

**In conclusion, Thorbis is poised to revolutionize the home services and local discovery sector.** By marrying the community-driven discovery features of a Yelp/Angi-like service with the mission-critical operational tools of field service management, we create something fundamentally new and defensible. We offer investors a chance to back a platform with dual network effects (consumer network and enterprise SaaS stickiness), multiple monetization avenues, and a massive addressable market that is ripe for innovation. The upside isn’t just theoretical – it’s grounded in observable trends and the demonstrated successes of partial models in each domain. **Our innovation is to bring it all together in one unified platform.** With seamless integration, a focus on trust and quality, and a scalable business model, Thorbis aims to become the go-to platform for everyone involved in home services – from the family needing an emergency repair to the contractor building a thriving business.

The future of local services is unified, and we’re building it now. We invite you to join us on this journey to transform a huge industry and create lasting value for all stakeholders. **Invest in the future of local discovery and service delivery – invest in Thorbis.**
