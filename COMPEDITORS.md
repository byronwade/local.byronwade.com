ServiceTitan is a leading field service management platform used by plumbing, HVAC, electrical, and general contracting businesses. However, its feature-rich system can be expensive and complex, prompting many companies to consider alternatives. Below, we identify five top competitors – spanning solutions for small trades businesses to enterprise contractors – and compare their strengths, pricing, key features, unique value propositions, and user satisfaction.

## 1. Jobber

**Overview:** *Jobber* is a popular all-in-one field service solution known for its user-friendly design. It’s widely used by small and mid-sized home service businesses (landscaping, cleaning, HVAC, plumbing, etc.) that need straightforward scheduling, invoicing, and customer management.

**Primary Features:** Jobber offers core features like job scheduling and dispatching (with a drag-and-drop calendar), client CRM, quoting and invoicing, online payments, and a robust mobile app for field technicians. It also provides a self-service **Client Hub** where customers can view quotes, pay invoices, and request jobs, enhancing communication. Integration with QuickBooks Online and other tools is supported for seamless accounting.

**Strengths:** Jobber’s greatest strength is ease-of-use. Its intuitive interface means **minimal training** is required for teams. Users consistently praise Jobber’s **excellent customer support** and quick onboarding. The software streamlines quoting-to-cash workflows – you can schedule jobs, send professional quotes/invoices, and collect payment all in one place. Jobber also automates client communications (reminders, follow-ups) to reduce admin work. Overall, it helps small businesses look professional with minimal effort.

**Pricing:** Jobber’s pricing is tiered by number of users. The **“Starter” plan is \$169 per month** (for 1–5 users). The **Grow plan is \$349/mo** (up to 10 users) and the **Premium plan \$599/mo** (up to 15 users, with advanced features). All plans include core features, and a free trial is available. (Notably, Jobber’s entry pricing is higher than some competitors, but it does not charge per-user fees below the plan’s user limit.)

**Unique Value Proposition:** Jobber positions itself as an easy, **“no-nonsense” solution for service businesses**. Compared to ServiceTitan, it’s often noted for faster setup and simpler administration, making it ideal for smaller teams without dedicated IT staff. It delivers a polished scheduling and invoicing workflow without the complexity of enterprise systems.

**User Reviews:** Jobber is *highly rated*. On G2, it scores \~**4.6 out of 5** (with 300+ reviews). Users frequently mention that Jobber is *easier to set up* and provides better support than ServiceTitan. Overall user satisfaction is very high, reflecting Jobber’s focus on simplicity and customer success.

## 2. Housecall Pro

**Overview:** *Housecall Pro* is a cloud-based field service platform aimed at small to mid-sized companies in HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and similar trades. It emphasizes a modern, mobile-first experience. Housecall Pro has gained significant market share by focusing on an intuitive UI and features that appeal to tech-savvy service professionals.

**Primary Features:** Key features include **job scheduling** (with a color-coded calendar and drag-and-drop changes), **dispatching**, **instant invoicing**, and **on-the-spot payment processing** (customers can even pay via text link). It has a built-in CRM for customer history, and it automates communications with clients (appointment reminders, follow-ups). Housecall Pro also stands out for its **marketing tools** – it offers email marketing, automated review requests, and even postcard mailers to help generate repeat business. A highly rated **mobile app** allows technicians to receive jobs, update status, generate invoices, and collect payments in the field.

**Strengths:** Housecall Pro is praised for its **excellent user experience**. The interface is sleek and easy to navigate, requiring little training. Its mobile app is often cited as one of the best in this segment, giving field techs all the info they need on the go. The platform also excels at **automation** – for example, it can send customers automatic appointment confirmations and reminders, helping reduce no-shows. Another strength is its **add-on integrations and marketing features**: businesses can automate follow-up emails, send thank-you notes or postcards, and use built-in reputation management tools to encourage online reviews. This focus on growth-oriented features (in addition to standard scheduling/dispatch) differentiates Housecall Pro.

**Pricing:** Housecall Pro offers straightforward tiered pricing. **Individual plan starts at \$59/month** (for owner-operators). The **“Grow” plan is \$149/month** for up to 5 users, and the **“Manage” plan is \$299/month** for companies (unlimited users, with the full feature set). These prices make it more affordable than ServiceTitan for small teams. (Note: advanced features like marketing automation are included in higher tiers.)

**Unique Value Proposition:** Housecall Pro’s unique edge is its **focus on ease-of-use and business growth**. It combines field service management with built-in marketing and customer experience tools (like branded customer communications and the ability for customers to tip technicians through the app). It’s an all-in-one platform for running *and* growing a home services business. Companies that want modern, streamlined software (and perhaps find ServiceTitan too complex) often gravitate to Housecall Pro for its simplicity and smart features.

**User Reviews:** Housecall Pro enjoys very positive reviews. It has about **4.7/5 stars on Capterra** and **4.3/5 on G2**. Users frequently highlight the intuitive interface and powerful mobile app. Many like that even non-technical staff can pick it up quickly. Some reviews note that it may lack a bit of the advanced customization large enterprises need, but for its target market, satisfaction is high.

## 3. FieldEdge

**Overview:** *FieldEdge* is a field service management system with deep roots in the HVAC industry. (It evolved from the dESCO ESC software, a long-time HVAC business solution.) FieldEdge is tailored for **service contractors**, especially HVAC, plumbing, and electrical companies. It covers both office operations and technician needs, with an emphasis on service history and accounting integration.

**Primary Features:** FieldEdge provides full **scheduling and dispatch** capabilities and a rich customer management system. A notable feature is its ability to track **customer equipment and service history** in detail – technicians can see past maintenance on a specific unit or appliance at the job site. It has built-in **invoicing and payment processing**, including support for flat-rate pricing books (helpful for HVAC/plumbing pricing) and digital signature capture on work orders. FieldEdge shines in **maintenance contract management** – it can automate service agreement renewals and scheduling. Another core feature is **inventory and parts tracking**: technicians can see van stock, and the office can manage inventory levels. Crucially, FieldEdge offers **seamless QuickBooks integration**, syncing customers, invoices, and payments to QuickBooks Desktop or Online. This tight accounting integration is a big selling point for many users.

**Strengths:** The strengths of FieldEdge lie in its **industry-specific focus** and depth. For HVAC and similar trades, FieldEdge offers features like a **customizable pricebook**, technician tracking (e.g., time stamps, efficiency reports), and even marketing tools for service agreements. The ability to drill down into **equipment-level history** helps technicians upsell or make informed service recommendations on site. Its QuickBooks integration greatly reduces double data entry for companies using QuickBooks for accounting. FieldEdge also supports multiple payment options and financing integrations, which can speed up cash flow for contractors. Overall, it’s a very comprehensive tool for running a service business, and many established HVAC/plumbing companies trust it as a backbone system.

**Pricing:** FieldEdge does not publish pricing, as it usually custom-quotes based on company size and needs. However, typical costs range from **\$125 to \$250 per user per month**, and there are often one-time setup fees (\~\$1,500–\$4,000 for implementation and training). This puts FieldEdge in a similar price bracket to ServiceTitan for larger teams, though small teams might negotiate lower tiers. While expensive, it’s worth noting that FieldEdge’s cost includes extensive functionality and support, and the ROI can be high for companies that leverage its features (e.g., improved tech efficiency and more sales from tracking service history).

**Unique Value Proposition:** FieldEdge’s unique value is being a **proven, contractor-focused platform**. It’s built by people who understand HVAC/plumbing business processes. Unlike more generic field service tools, FieldEdge comes with out-of-the-box support for things like flat-rate pricing books, **service agreements**, and advanced **QuickBooks accounting sync** – features that companies often had to bolt on separately. This makes FieldEdge a strong ServiceTitan alternative for businesses that want similar power but in a slightly more accounting-centric package. Also, FieldEdge has been noted to offer very strong customer support and training for its users, which helps with adoption.

**User Reviews:** FieldEdge has *generally favorable* reviews. It’s rated roughly **4.2/5 on Capterra and 4.1/5 on G2**. Users love the **integration with QuickBooks and the detailed tracking** of customer info. Many HVAC businesses mention that FieldEdge significantly improved their office efficiency. However, some reviews point out that it has a **steeper learning curve** for new users and that the UI isn’t as modern as some newer apps. There are also occasional critiques of cost. Overall, satisfaction is high in its core market, but new users should be prepared for a thorough onboarding to fully utilize it.

## 4. simPRO

**Overview:** *simPRO* is an enterprise-grade field service **and project management** software solution. Originating from Australia, simPRO now serves contractors worldwide. It is designed for **medium to large businesses**, particularly those managing complex projects, multiple crews, or even multiple branch locations. simPRO is used in industries like electrical contracting, plumbing, HVAC, security, and other trades, especially where project work (installations, construction, large-scale maintenance contracts) is involved alongside service jobs.

**Primary Features:** simPRO offers a very extensive feature set:

* **Job management & scheduling:** Coordinate everything from one-off service calls to multi-day projects. Dispatchers can assign jobs based on technician skills, location, and availability, and simPRO supports visual scheduling with both calendar and map views.
* **Project management:** Unlike many FSM tools, simPRO lets you manage large projects with phases, labor/material budgets, Gantt charts, and progress billing for long-term jobs.
* **Quoting/Estimating:** Build detailed quotes and estimates, including assemblies of parts/labor, which is great for project bids.
* **Inventory and asset management:** simPRO has robust **multi-warehouse inventory tracking**, supplier/vendor management (it can even generate purchase orders), and it tracks customer assets for maintenance schedules.
* **Invoicing & Payments:** Generate invoices (including partial invoices for project milestones) and take payments. It supports batch invoicing and integrates with payment gateways. Multi-currency support is built-in for international operations.
* **Reporting & analytics:** simPRO includes extensive reporting and even business intelligence dashboards for monitoring KPIs across the business (job costing, profitability, technician performance, etc.).
* **Integrations:** Integrates with accounting systems like QuickBooks, Xero, MYOB, and others, plus offers APIs for custom integrations.
* **Mobile apps:** Field technicians can use a mobile app to view jobs, clock time, add notes, and even handle asset inspections or compliance forms on site.

**Strengths:** The key strength of simPRO is its **depth and scalability**. It’s one of the few field service platforms that can truly handle an **enterprise’s complexity** – whether that’s thousands of inventory items, multi-step projects, or detailed financial tracking. Companies often choose simPRO when they feel they have outgrown simpler systems. It excels at **project costing and job costing** – you can see in real time if a job or project is over budget on labor or materials. The **inventory management** is also superior to many competitors (important for contractors who stock and sell parts). Another strength is simPRO’s flexibility: it allows significant customization of workflows, fields, and templates, so larger organizations can tailor it to their needs. In essence, simPRO combines field service management with some ERP-like capabilities for contractors.

**Pricing:** simPRO’s pricing is quote-based. Their model is modular – you pay for the core platform and then additional modules or add-ons (like maintenance planning, assets, etc.) as needed. While exact pricing isn’t public, *typical* costs **start around \$99 per user per month**, and there are often substantial **implementation fees (\$3k–\$15k)** for onboarding and training. This reflects its enterprise focus – initial setup can be complex, sometimes requiring simPRO consultants or a dedicated internal admin to configure the system optimally. For a mid-size company with, say, 10 users, the recurring cost might be in the low thousands per month. It’s a bigger investment, but often justified by the efficiency gains for larger operations.

**Unique Value Proposition:** simPRO’s unique value is providing **ERP-level functionality for field service**. It differentiates itself from ServiceTitan by offering more advanced project features (e.g. construction project management tools) and deeper inventory/warehouse controls. If ServiceTitan is known for being all-in-one for service calls, simPRO goes a step further to handle bigger contracts and installations. It’s often the go-to for companies that need a system to manage both **service and project work** in one. Additionally, simPRO has strong multi-entity capabilities (useful if a contractor operates several companies or franchises). In short, it’s the choice when you need an enterprise solution that can be customized to your business processes and scaled up.

**User Reviews:** simPRO earns a solid reputation with users, though tempered by its complexity. It holds roughly **4.1/5 stars on both G2 and Capterra**. Users commend its ability to **“handle advanced workflows”** and appreciate the powerful reporting tools that give insight into their operations. Many reviews note that once fully implemented, simPRO greatly improved their visibility and control over projects and finances. On the flip side, some users mention the **steep learning curve and onboarding challenges** – it may take time (and training) to get the most out of simPRO, especially for those coming from simpler software. Overall, for those who need its expansive feature set, satisfaction is high, but it’s not aimed at very small businesses.

## 5. Workiz

**Overview:** *Workiz* is a newer entrant gaining popularity among small and medium field service businesses. It’s especially favored by home service companies like locksmiths, appliance repair, garage door repair, cleaning services, as well as HVAC/plumbing contractors who value its built-in communication tools. Workiz positions itself as an easy-to-use platform that balances functionality with simplicity.

**Primary Features:** Workiz covers all standard FSM features: **job scheduling and dispatch**, a built-in CRM for managing leads and customers, **estimates and invoices**, and payment processing (with online credit card payments and the ability to offer financing). It also supports scheduling recurring jobs and service contracts for maintenance work. What really sets Workiz apart is its integrated **phone and communication system**: Workiz includes a VOIP phone system with features like call tracking, call recording, automated SMS alerts, and even a virtual dispatcher that can route calls to the right person. This means when customers call, the system can log the call, associate it with the customer record, and you can track how many calls turn into jobs (excellent for marketing insight). Workiz also offers an **AI-powered phone assistant** in its top tier, and features like “conversation intelligence” to analyze calls. Additionally, there’s a mobile app for technicians to receive jobs, update status, collect payments, and communicate with the office.

**Strengths:** The main strengths of Workiz are its **ease of use** and its **communication tools**. The interface is clean and modern, so most users find they need very little training to get started. It’s built with small business owners in mind rather than IT specialists. The integrated phone system is a unique strength – it’s incredibly handy to have your business line, texts, and job management in one place. This helps track leads (no more lost sticky notes about “who called about that job”) and can improve customer service with faster response times. Another strength is Workiz’s focus on helping businesses grow: it includes features like lead management with conversion tracking and even marketing add-ons (like a partnership with online directories, etc.). Customers also frequently praise Workiz’s **customer support** and onboarding team, which is important for small businesses that might need extra help transitioning from pen-and-paper or spreadsheets.

**Pricing:** Workiz’s pricing is packaged by team size and features. The **Starter plan is \$225/month** for 1–3 users. A **Team plan costs \$275/month** for up to 5 users, adding more features. Their **Pro plan starts at \$325/month** (also up to 5 users, but includes the AI phone features and more advanced tools). These plans are higher-priced than some other small-business tools, but they include the phone system minutes and texts in many cases, which might replace an external phone service. Workiz often highlights that it can replace several tools (phone system, scheduling software, etc.) with one platform.

**Unique Value Proposition:** Workiz’s unique value prop is its **all-in-one communication + field service platform**. It’s one of the only FSM tools with a built-in, AI-enhanced phone system. For businesses that rely heavily on phone calls (which is most home services), this is a game-changer – you can record calls for training, automatically log them to jobs, and even have an auto-attendant. ServiceTitan also offers robust call tracking, but Workiz provides this at a lower price point and with simplicity. Additionally, Workiz emphasizes being *“friendly”* software – it’s cloud-based, quick to deploy, and doesn’t overwhelm users with complexity. It’s ideal for small companies that want to appear very professional and efficient in their communications without a huge software investment.

**User Reviews:** Workiz garners strong user satisfaction ratings. On G2, it’s rated around **4.6/5** and on Capterra about **4.5/5**. Users love how Workiz has “**freed up time**” and made their operations more efficient, especially when it comes to scheduling and invoicing. The ease of use is a recurring theme – many say they were able to get going quickly and that the interface feels modern and straightforward. The phone features also receive praise; small businesses appreciate not missing leads and having all client communications tracked in one system. Some noted limitations include that Workiz may **lack some advanced features for larger operations** – for example, its reporting, while good, isn’t as in-depth as ServiceTitan or simPRO, and it has less customization for complex workflows. But for its target market (teams of a few dozen or less), it hits the sweet spot of functionality vs. simplicity.

Below is a **comparison table** summarizing key points about these competitors:
